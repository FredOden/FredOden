- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FredOden, I was among few people mastering Unix and C/C++,Pascal, lisp, prolog in the 70's & 80's in the IT industry.
Was also specialist for perl, tk/tcl scripting languages for financial industry and aeronautical industry
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring languages, particularly rust, javascript, java, c++, python.
Embedding scripting languages in "compiled" software to facilitate
functional dÃ©velopment.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently evaluating differences between those languages: performance, ease of dÃ©velopment, readability, code maintenance etc...
Many of my repositories are proofs of concept
